# Snap Gallery

Images can be hosted from anywere and merely linked to through the `gallery.json` file.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Publishing

Change the name of the website in the `package.json` file's build script to your own.
To publish your changes to the live version of the website, run the the `ng run git-r-done` command.
